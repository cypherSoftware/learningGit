MY GIT CHEAT SHEET


git clone <pathToRepositoryCanBeHttporSSH> (clones a new repository and starts tracking it)
git status (returns status of everyfile in your working directory.)
git restore --staged <fileOrDirectory> (Un adds a staged file.  Goes back to untracked)
git status -s gives you short verion. First column is staging area
            second collumn is working tree. A=add ??=untracked M=modified
git config --list (will list all the config settings. --global --local optional)

NOTES: 
The top directory of your working directory tree has the .git directory that tracks eveyrhting
ex: ~/aDirectory/MyRepository/adirectoryOfFiles/aSubDirectory
    if you clone a repositroy into aDirectory and name it MyRepository.
    MyRepositrory will contain the .git directory

git add and a file name adds that file.  if it's a directory it adds recursively
And you can add a list of files to add by seperating by spaces.
